These roles define the permissions and settings associated with users assigned to these roles in the Frappe framework. Roles are a way to manage access control and permissions for different users within the system. The roles described in this file appear to be related to a "Drive" application, with "Drive Admin" having higher-level permissions compared to "Drive User."
