The provided Python code seems to be part of a Frappe module for generating thumbnails for images and videos associated with entities in a file or document management system. Let's break down the code and understand its functionality:
create_image_thumbnail Function:

python

@frappe.whitelist(allow_guest=True)
def create_image_thumbnail(entity_name):
    # ... (function documentation)
    # ... (retrieving information about the Drive Entity)
    # ... (checking permissions for viewing the file)
    # ... (acquiring a distributed lock for the entity's path)

    if frappe.cache().exists(entity_name):
        # ... (if the thumbnail is cached, retrieve and return it)
    else:
        # ... (if the thumbnail is not cached, read it from file)
        # ... (wrap the thumbnail data in a Response object)
        # ... (set Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers)
        # ... (cache the thumbnail data for future use)

    return response

    This function generates thumbnails for image files associated with a specified entity.
    It checks if the thumbnail is already cached in the Frappe cache and returns it if found.
    If the thumbnail is not cached, it reads the thumbnail data from a file and creates a Response object.
    The generated thumbnail data is cached for subsequent requests.

create_video_thumbnail Function:

python

@frappe.whitelist(allow_guest=True)
def create_video_thumbnail(entity_name):
    # ... (function documentation)
    # ... (similar structure to create_image_thumbnail)

    This function is similar to create_image_thumbnail but is intended for generating thumbnails for video files.

Overview:

    The functions use Frappe's whitelist decorator to allow guest access.
    They retrieve information about the Drive Entity associated with the provided entity_name.
    Permissions are checked to ensure that the user has the right to view the specified file.
    Distributed locks are used to handle concurrent requests and ensure safe access to the entity's path.
    Thumbnails are either retrieved from the cache or read from a file.
    The thumbnail data is wrapped in a Response object with appropriate headers and returned.

Overall, these functions provide a mechanism for generating and serving thumbnails for images and videos associated with entities in a file or document management system. They handle caching to optimize performance and utilize Frappe's framework for interacting with documents and distributed locks.
