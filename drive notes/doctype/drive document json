        creation: Date and time of creation
        modified: Date and time of the last modification
        modified_by: User who last modified the DocType
        autoname: "hash" - Indicates the method used for generating the document's name automatically
        naming_rule: "Random" - Indicates the rule used for naming documents automatically
        default_view: "List" - Specifies the default view for this DocType

    Fields:
        Two fields are defined:
            title (Text): Represents the title of the document. It is required and visible in the list view.
            content (Long Text): Represents the content of the document. It has a default value of "AAA=".

    Permissions:
        Two sets of permissions are defined for roles "Drive User" and "Drive Admin":
            Both roles have permissions for create, delete, export, read, share, and write operations.

    Other Attributes:
        allow_rename: Allows renaming of documents.
        editable_grid: Indicates that the document allows editing in a grid view.
